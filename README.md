# SAPRISE_WAF_Web

This is an ASP.NET Core MVC web application that will display data from an Excel file, with each worksheet as a separate page. The main page will show data from the first worksheet, and navigation links will be provided for each worksheet.

## Next Steps
- Integrate Excel file reading (using a library like EPPlus or ClosedXML)
- Display the first worksheet on the main page
- Add navigation for each worksheet

This README will be updated as the project progresses.
